&emsp;&emsp;Kumiko was an old discord bot started in 2018 and with the introduction of slash commands, felt like now is the time more than ever if I was going to rewrite the bot from scratch. Please give a few weeks for it to go live as I am in the very early stages of development, thank you.

&emsp;&emsp;What I want to achieve with this bot is going to start small. The first feature will be `Anime` commands since Kumiko is well, yeah. Further features are unplanned.

<div align="center"><h2>Features</h2>
    Here are just some of the features to come as I work further on the bot.

> config.json is not listed in the repository so here is the code in the file

 ```json
{
    "token": "[your-token-here]",
    "author": "Akross",
    "version": "0.4",
    "clientId": "[your-client-id]",
    "guildId": "[your-guild-id]"
}
```

- Since this current build is not ready, I am only deploying to my private server and the github repo is purely for tracking purposes through development until officially releasing to the public with hosting.

- I by no means know what I am doing, so if there are optimizations or any tips to provide, please say so!
