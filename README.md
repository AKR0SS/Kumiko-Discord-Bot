    Hello, I am currently rewritting the Kumiko discord bot for better functionality and user experience. Please give a few weeks for it to go live as I am in the very early stages of development, thank you.
    <br></br>
    I am unsure of what this bot is currently aiming to be, but I want a firm foundation to be able to go in whichever direction that the bot is going to develop into.

## Needed Files

> config.json is not listed in the repository so here is the code in the file

 ```json
{
    "token": "[your-token-here]",
    "author": "Akross",
    "version": "0.1",
}
```

This is my first time learning js, if you have any tips please say so :)
