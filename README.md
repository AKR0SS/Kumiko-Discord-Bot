&emsp;&emsp;Kumiko was an old discord bot started in 2018 and with the introduction of slash commands, felt like now is the time more than ever if I was going to rewrite the bot from scratch. Please give a few weeks for it to go live as I am in the very early stages of development, thank you.

&emsp;&emsp;I would like to keep this bot as barebone and simple for not only optimizations, but readability. I am hoping that this could be a learning experience not only for me, but for other developers wanting to learn Discord js and javascript as a language.

<div align="center"><h2>Features</h2>
    Here are just some of the features to come as I work further on the bot.

<h2 align="center">Files</h2>

> config.json is not listed in the repository so here is the code in the file

 ```json
{
    "token": "[your-token-here]",
    "author": "Akross",
    "version": "0.6",
    "clientId": "[your-client-id]",
    "guildId": "[your-guild-id]"
}
```

<h2 align="center">Disclaimer</h2>

- I am slowly trying to roll out a stable build of the bot and am currently locally hosting the bot so if there is any downtime, I apologize as I may be working on the bot.

- I by no means know what I am doing, so if there are optimizations or any tips to provide, please say so!
