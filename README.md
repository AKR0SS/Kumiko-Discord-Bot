    <p>
    &emsp;&emsp;Hello, I am currently rewritting the Kumiko discord bot for better functionality and user experience. Please give a few weeks for it to go live as I am in the very early stages of development, thank you.
    <br></br>
    &emsp;&emsp;I am unsure of what this bot is currently aiming to be, but I want a firm foundation to be able to go in whichever direction that the bot is going to develop into.
    </p>

<div align="center"><h2>Features</h2>
    Here are just some of the features to come as I work further on the bot.

<div align="center"><h2>Files</h2></div>

> config.json is not listed in the repository so here is the code in the file

 ```json
{
    "token": "[your-token-here]",
    "author": "Akross",
    "version": "0.3",
    "clientId": "[your-client-id]",
    "guildId": "[your-guild-id]"
}
```

<div align="center"><h2>Disclaimer</h2></div>

- Since this current build is not ready, I am only deploying to my private server and the github repo is purely for tracking purposes through development until officially releasing to the public with hosting.

- I by no means know what I am doing, so if there are optimizations or any tips to provide, please say so!
